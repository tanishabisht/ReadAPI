## Problem Statements

When working in a team, documenting an API is really important so that deveopment becomes faster and work is streamlined between front-end and bac-end devs. It helps to get an overall picture of how it is going to be implemented. This gives some structure to visualise the models and schemas.

## Proposed Solutions

A tool for documenting APIs - `ReadAPI`

## Features added

- listing all the documentation created
- Add new documentation
  - Add new models
    - Add modelName, schema name, schema type, and an example
  - Add new APIs for the respective models
    - Response from the server
    - Request from client
    - HTTP type

## Future Aspects

Getting more features such as :

- enabling user authentication
- adding on to back-end boilerplate
- to be decided...

## Tech Stack Used

- MongoDB
- React
- Express
- NodeJS
- AdobeXD for UI design
